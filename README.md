This is a test React app used for checking what games you have in common with your friends on Steam.

It is very much my first time using React, Javascript, or any sort of Web API, so some of the code is a little messy -- but it works! Everything even resizes dynamically based on the size of your screen, so it functions well on mobile devices too. I've been using this tool all the time throughout quarantine when playing games with my friends.

It uses the Steam API, and currently requires that you supply your own Steam API key and Steam User ID in the index.js file.

Here are some screenshots of the working application:
