This is a test React app used for checking what games you have in common with your friends on Steam.

It is very much my first time using React, Javascript, or any sort of Web API, so some of the code is a little messy -- but it works! Everything even resizes dynamically based on the size of your screen, so it functions well on mobile devices too. I've been using this tool all the time throughout quarantine when playing games with my friends.

If you want to try it out, add your own Steam user ID and your own Steam API key to the marked locations in index.js, then run "npm start" in the command shell of your choosing.

Here are some screenshots of the working application:
