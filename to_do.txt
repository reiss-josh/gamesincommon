CURRENT STUFF:
* clean up the loading graphic
  -> after some time out period, show the currently present error message

* overhaul the app page CSS

* make it so that wider windows have double-wide list of friends

* add hover coloring or shadow or something

* make scrollbars look nicer

ACTUAL BUGS:
* selecting users who have private libraries or private accounts breaks everything
* entering an invalid, numeric vanityurl results in crash
* sometimes pulling from firebase erroneously when clicking additional user - don't know why
* need to swap firebase keys from name to appid
* clean database: games marked "Multiplayer" but not "Online" should show "online"
* clean database: games marked "LAN" should not be Local.
