final app:

CURRENT STUFF:
* add a login page -- leads to main page, passes logged in info. store in a context.
  -> handleFriendsList ought to use this object.
* fix https: error on game banners

BIG STUFF:
* hand off network requests somehow -- don't expose api key.
* make it so that wider windows have double-wide list of friends
* add hover coloring
* implement firebase:
  -> whenever about to make an API call, try checking the database first.
  -> if it's not in the database, add it in after retrieving it.
  (gonna store a JSON of every steam game i guess...)

LESS IMPORTANT:
* offer a loading circle while games list is being updated
  -> after some time out period, show the currently present error message
* format the buttons/lists to look nice
  -> maybe add a hover-over response of some sort
* make scrollbars look nicer

UNKNOWN SIZE STUFF:
add particular sorts:
  logged user hours
  all selected user hours
  alphabetized
  random
