final app:

BIG STUFF:
* add a login page -- leads to main page, passes logged in info
* hand off network requests somehow -- don't expose api key.

* allow scrolling of the friends/games list separate from scrolling the page
* format the buttons/lists to look nice
* offer a loading circle while games list is being updated
  -> after some time out period, show the currently present error message
* make page resize to fit window

UNKNOWN SIZE STUFF:
add particular sorts:
  logged user hours
  all selected user hours
  alphabetized
  random
