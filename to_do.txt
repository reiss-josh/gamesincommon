final app:

CURRENT STUFF:
  made index.js a little dumber
  

BIG STUFF:
* add a login page -- leads to main page, passes logged in info
* hand off network requests somehow -- don't expose api key.
* fix left-side margin on scroll for mobile/extremely thin window
* hover color does not always clear properly (scrolling, the weird margin thing on thin windows)

LESS IMPORTANT:
* offer a loading circle while games list is being updated
  -> after some time out period, show the currently present error message
* format the buttons/lists to look nice
  -> maybe add a hover-over response of some sort
* make scrollbars look nicer

UNKNOWN SIZE STUFF:
add particular sorts:
  logged user hours
  all selected user hours
  alphabetized
  random
