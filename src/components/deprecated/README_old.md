for this to work, you need to:

1) clone the repository

2) go here (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and get an api key

3) make a new file named "config.js"

4) in config.js, write the following, replacing the Xs with your api key and the Ys with your steamID:<br>
var apiKey = "XXXXXXX";<br>
var steamID = "YYYYYY";

5) open up index.html!



NOTE: if you try comparing with a friend who has their games library set to private, you will not get any results.
